# (Topological) Schemes and their induced maps

In topology, and especially descriptive set theory, one often constructs functions `(ℕ → β) → α`,
where α is some topological space and β is a discrete space, as an appropriate limit of some map
`List β → Set α`. We call the latter type of map a "`β`-scheme on `α`".

This file develops the basic, abstract theory of these schemes and the functions they induce.

## Main Definitions

* `CantorScheme.inducedMap A` : The aforementioned "limit" of a scheme `A : List β → Set α`.
  This is a partial function from `ℕ → β` to `a`,
  implemented here as an object of type `Σ s : Set (ℕ → β), s → α`.
  That is, `(inducedMap A).1` is the domain and `(inducedMap A).2` is the function.

## Implementation Notes

We consider end-appending to be the fundamental way to build lists (say on `β`) inductively,
as this interacts better with the topology on `ℕ → β`.
As a result, functions like `List.get?` or `Stream'.take` do not have their intended meaning
in this file. See instead `PiNat.res`.

We call this the map induced by the scheme. -/
