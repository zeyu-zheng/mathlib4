# Compact separated uniform spaces

## Main statements

* `compactSpace_uniformity`: On a compact uniform space, the topology determines the
  uniform structure, entourages are exactly the neighborhoods of the diagonal.

* `uniformSpace_of_compact_t2`: every compact T2 topological structure is induced by a uniform
  structure. This uniform structure is described in the previous item.

* **Heine-Cantor** theorem: continuous functions on compact uniform spaces with values in uniform
  spaces are automatically uniformly continuous. There are several variations, the main one is
  `CompactSpace.uniformContinuous_of_continuous`.

## Implementation notes

The construction `uniformSpace_of_compact_t2` is not declared as an instance, as it would badly
loop.
